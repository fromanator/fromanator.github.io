We are so excited to share our wedding day with you!

Saturday, December 10, 2016.

# What's the schedule of events?
The ceremony starts at 5:30 PM.  
Dinner buffet at 6 PM  
Live swing music by <a href="http://pattyandthebuttons.com/">Patty and the Buttons</a> from 7-10 PM.  
Bring your dancing shoes!

# Wait, you're getting married in a cave?

The <a href="http://www.wabashastreetcaves.com/">Wabasha Street Caves</a>
is a unique event center, built into the sandstone bluffs by the
Mississippi River. In the 1920s, it served as a gangster hideout and speakeasy (more
history here). The Caves hosts a weekly swing night. This is where Andrew spotted
Andrea on the dancefloor, and asked her to dance for the first time. In December, we&#39;ll
have another "first dance" at the Caves-- as husband and wife!

# But what if I don't know how to swing dance?
No problem! Cut a rug however you like. For those who are interested, we are hoping to hold an informal 
lesson in swing dancing basics before the music starts. We'll keep you posted.

# What should I wear?
Semi-formal dress. Ladies, flats are always welcome for the dancefloor! 
(Even the bride might slip into her Keds to do some lindy hop, wink wink)

# Where should I park?
Free parking is provided in front of the building. There's also overflow parking in the Health Partners 
Pharmacy lot next door.

# Will there be an open bar?
We will host some wine and beer for the evening! Please consider having some cash on hand for sodas and other beverages.

# Are kids welcome?
Absolutely! Your little ones are a big part of your life, and we would love to share our special day with your whole family.

# Do you have a registry?
We are grateful to already have much of what we need to set up our first home together! We do have a small registry at Target, or gift cards would be much appreciated.  Gift checks will be put toward a down payment on a house. Your love, your joy, and your company on our wedding day are the greatest gift of all!
